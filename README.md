Blockchain technology is the distributed, decentralized and digital ledger that 
stores transactional information in the form of blocks in many database/nodecomputers which are connected with the chains. Blockchain technology is secure 
as the data stored once in the chain is immutable therefore any block cannot be 
changed or hacked. By using Blockchain technology, customers or users do not 
need to rely on third party users for confirmation of product authenticity and 
safety. In recent years, blockchain has received increasing attention and 
numerous applications have emerged from this technology. In this idea we are 
using a Decentralized Blockchain technology approach to ensure that consumers 
do not fully rely on the merchants to determine if products are genuine.
